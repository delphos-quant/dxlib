=================================

**dxlib** is a quantitative trading and analysis library for python. It aims to
provide a flexible, easy-to-use, and high-performance trading framework that
can be used to develop and backtest trading strategies.

Perform backtests on historical data, and analyze the results, as well as live
trading with multiple brokers. Develop and test your own trading strategies,
and deploy them as a fully automated trading system.

Check out the :doc:`` section for further information.
